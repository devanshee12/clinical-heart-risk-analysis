# clinical-heart-risk-analysis
Clinical Prediction Model (Heart Rate, Glucose, Cholesterol → Survival Rate); ECG Classification Model – Gives confusion matrix and detects heart rhythm problems

# ❤️ Clinical Heart Risk Analysis

This repository includes two medical ML projects:

## 1. [🩺 Clinical Prediction Model](./clinical-prediction-model)
Predicts survival rate based on health metrics like heart rate, glucose, and cholesterol.

## 2. [💓 ECG Classification Model](./ecg-classification-model)
Classifies ECG signals to detect potential heart conditions.
