# 💓 ECG Classification Model

This project classifies ECG signals to detect heart abnormalities like arrhythmia using a machine learning pipeline.

## 🩻 Input
- ECG signal data (RR interval, QRS width)

## 🧠 Model
- Random Forest / SVM / Neural Net (as used)
- Outputs confusion matrix and metrics

## 📁 Files
- `ecg_classification.ipynb`: Notebook containing model, training, and evaluation

## ✅ How to Run
- Load ECG dataset
- Preprocess features
- Train and evaluate model
